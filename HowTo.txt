You need:
"Make", "Python3", "GCC"

Running:
- make
- cd ./bin
- ./generate_data

If you're on Windows, the name of the file will be "generate_data.exe"

- python3 ./src/Python/graph.py
- cd ./data

Feel free to save the shown graph into a png. This will be automatized in the future.
If you wish to use docker, you can either build it yourself or pull it.

Note: You WILL have to use interactive terminal, for now...

Build it:
sudo docker build -t time_complexity_data .

Pull it:
sudo docker pull maya1248/time_complexity_data



File hierarchy:
/bin - Compiled binaries
/data - Final results, data
/src/C - Source C code
/src/Python - Source Python code
/tmp - Temporary files that change rapidly are stored here

/Makefile - For compiling source C code
/README.md - Intro into the project.
/HowTo.txt - This file.
