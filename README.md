# time_complexity_data
Long term goal of this project is to time and graph as many different sorting algorithms as possible.
No parallelization, just raw sorting on a single piece of hardware and graphing the results.

Note:
We are not interested in the actual time required to sort as this can easily depend on the hardware alone.
What we are interested in is the overall shape/slope of the graph.

Time complexities for various sorting algorithms already exist, this project exists purely so you may
create the actual data yourself and graph it yourself.

You may provide existing sorting algorithms to see if they match existing average time complexities.
You may be bold and provide your own custom sorting alg. and observe the behavior through the graph.
